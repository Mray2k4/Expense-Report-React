## Summary
This was my first project in React. It was difficult to learn initally but I grasped the concept fast. Writing the code was an easy transition, as its similar to javascript. The useState, props and components, all have their learning curve which was fun to learn. I'm excited to see what I'm able to create moving forward with React. Also Importing other files was a bit challenging part for me too. So I need to learn that some more when I get into more complex projects.
